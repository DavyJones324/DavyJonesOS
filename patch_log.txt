  default C-Drive. This temporary call directory will not be saved upon exiting the batch script.
* Added new auxiliary commands and shortcuts that allow the batch script to open new places such as AppData, Desktop, Documents,
  Downloads, Home, Music, Pictures, and Videos folders.
* Added a list of various compiler tools, both old and new, to the Background menu. The full list is displayed in that section.
* Removed JDK and JRE installers from the compatibility list, as they should be used as a reference point, not as a way to execute
  compiler tool installation.

* Added and adjusted additional lines of code to change the priority of dialer input execution from shortest strings to longest.
  For string fragments, the opposite will be true instead - from longest strings to shortest. Word strings are organized alphabetically.
  This results in the program being optimized, but the code structure is obfuscated for human reading purposes.
* The alphabetical template will now come with its own separate dialer functions and search engine. Think of it like formatting a brain,
  but with coding. This makes it so the batch script doesn't lag as much when executing commands from any menu. Additionally, the Alpha,
  Beta, Gamma, and Menu commands will now change the startup setting of the Applications shortcut.
* Additional bug fixes.
* This will be the last major patch associated with the main menu, including with my 3 new built-in alphabetical templates. From now on,
  only maintenance patches will be released for any future undiscovered bugs this batch program may have. Code away with the alphabetical
  templates in peace, and see what other programs you can add into the script!
