* Added RustDesk to the Workspace menu alongside AnyDesk.
* Added ScreenConnect to the Workspace menu alongside RemotePC.
* VbsEdit, made by Adersoft, is not able to be added to the Davy Jones OS script due to VBScript's deprecation as a scripting language
  by its namesake creator, Microsoft. Both Adersoft and VbsEdit have become honorable mentions due to the fact that I would have
  incorporated them into the batch script launcher if VBS weren't in the process of being phased out. Visual Basic (.NET), on the other
  hand, remains supported by Microsoft to this day. (Website: https://www.vbsedit.com/; Trialware, Proprietary; Adersoft 2001-2025.)

Patch 1.3.0.0

* Added XZ to the CLI menu alongside The Unarchiver.
* Added the GnuWin32 CLI menu, which will replace the Other CLI Utilities section. Bzip2, Gzip, and Tar CLI Tools are added for reference.
* Added new functionality for how to configure install options as well as manage the given uninstall options for the GnuWin32 section.
  More programs may be added from both the GNU and SourceForge websites so they can be run with the included GnuWin32 path manager.
* GnuWin32 and the Frankenstein folder options have swapped places (GnuWin32 is now Option 8, Frankenstein Folder is now Option 9)
* Added the Ruby Programming Language to the Versions section, as well as in Menu 3 alongside Python.
* Added the Java Version Manager, the PowerShell Version Manager, the Ruby Version Manager, and, most importantly, the Python Version

  For string fragments, the opposite will be true instead - from longest strings to shortest. Word strings are organized alphabetically.
  This results in the program being optimized, but the code structure is obfuscated for human reading purposes.
* The alphabetical template will now come with its own separate dialer functions and search engine. Think of it like formatting a brain,
  but with coding. This makes it so the batch script doesn't lag as much when executing commands from any menu. Additionally, the Alpha,
  Beta, Gamma, and Menu commands will now change the startup setting of the Applications shortcut.
* Additional bug fixes.
* This will be the last major patch associated with the main menu, including with my 3 new built-in alphabetical templates. From now on,
  only maintenance patches will be released for any future undiscovered bugs this batch program may have. Code away with the alphabetical
  templates in peace, and see what other programs you can add into the script!

  from the main menu should give the correct prompt. The associated shortcuts are also added here.
