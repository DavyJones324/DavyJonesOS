Patch 1.1.2.1

* As a final surprise parting gift before actual maintainence mode, I have added Atom Editor, Pulsar Editor, Sublime Text Editor, and Vim
  Editor to Menu 3, all while merging MATLAB with Octave.

Patch 1.1.2

* Addd a new auxiliary command which allows the user to temporarily change the call directory to a different installed drive from the
  default C-Drive. This temporary call directory will not be saved upon exiting the batch script.
* Added new auxiliary commands and shortcuts that allow the batch script to open new places such as AppData, Desktop, Documents,
  Downloads, Home, Music, Pictures, and Videos folders.
* Added a list of various compiler tools, both old and new, to the Background menu. The full list is displayed in that section.
* Removed JDK and JRE installers from the compatibility list, as they should be used as a reference point, not as a way to execute
  compiler tool installation.
* Added BabelPad and ImHex to the Background menu alongside Notepad and Notepad++.
* Added WinCompose and Wise Auto Shutdown to the Background menu alongside QuickLook and Flow Launcher.
* Improved the PuTTY menu to include some programs that came with the installer, as well as a couple of additional experimental programs.
  PuTTY programs that can only be executed via command prompt are named PLink, PSCP, and PSFTP.
* Added Supremo to the Workspace menu alongside TeamSpeak.
* Added Binary Ninja to Menu 5 alongside Hex-Rays IDA.
* Added the Serif Affinity trio to Menu 5 alongside ON1 Photo RAW, which now has the remaining ON1 software included as a suite.
* Added Asperite to Menu 5 alongside Photoline.
* Added a list of other file management programs alongside Calibre that can handle DRM, EPUB, Kindle, Audible, PDF, Music, and Videos:
   * Alfa Reader & eBooks Manager
   * NoteBurner Suite
   * Epubor Suite
   * TunePat Suite
   * A list of other programs with names starting with "Any".
* Added Soundpad to Menu 9a alongside OpenMPT.
* Added CreamInstaller to the Keys menu alongside ReShade, which includes an important warning to read before use.
* Added GlassWire to Menu 9c alongside Portmaster.
* Relocated OpenVPN to the Background menu alongside Wireguard.
* Added Surfshark to Menu 9c alongside other VPNs.
* Added Astrill VPN to Menu 9c alongside other VPNs, but with an important note attached meant for a specific group of scammers.
* Added BabelMap to Menu 9c alongside Character Map.
* Added Krita to Menu 9c alongside the other paint programs.
* Added and adjusted additional lines of code to change the priority of dialer input execution from shortest strings to longest.
  For string fragments, the opposite will be true instead - from longest strings to shortest. Word strings are organized alphabetically.
  This results in the program being optimized, but the code structure is obfuscated for human reading purposes.
* The alphabetical template will now come with its own separate dialer functions and search engine. Think of it like formatting a brain,
  but with coding. This makes it so the batch script doesn't lag as much when executing commands from any menu. Additionally, the Alpha,
  Beta, Gamma, and Menu commands will now change the startup setting of the Applications shortcut.
* Additional bug fixes.
* This will be the last major patch associated with the main menu, including with my 3 new built-in alphabetical templates. From now on,
  only maintenance patches will be released for any future undiscovered bugs this batch program may have. Code away with the alphabetical
  templates in peace, and see what other programs you can add into the script!

Patch 1.1.1

* Added Revo Registry Cleaner to the Alert menu alongside Revo Uninstaller.
* Added Defraggler to the list, but it can only be searched for in the search engine and is not associated with any menu.

* Reworked the Installer menu, and added new installer manufacturing/utility programs to the list. These programs include:
   * InstallAware
   * InstalledPackagesView

   * Nullsoft Scripted Install System (NSIS)
   * WiX Toolset
* Added LogViewer, Universal Viewer, Advanced Renamer, and Attribute Changer to the Coding menu alongside 010 Editor, now named as
  Universal Viewers/Editors.
* Reworked the entire JetBrains menu to now include 2 pages instead of 3; JetBrains Aqua and Writerside have been removed due to policy.
* Added RoboDK to the Sandbox menu alongside the Slic3r Tools menu, now renamed as Robot Utilities.
* Polished the Engineering Tools menu for a couple of listed programs.
* Added Dependency Walker and PowerToys to the Portable menu and compressed the dnSpy options from that menu to a simpler selection.

* Additional bug fixes.

* Added ChemDraw and ChemOffice to menu 9c, including some shortcuts, alongside the other paint programs. The 64-bit shortcuts will be
  enabled by default. However, both 32-bit and 64-bit shortcut backups will be included here.

* Added the correct amount of spacing and visuals for all exit prompts.
* Added the exit codes for the extra batch scripts meant to open Visual Studio Code and Godot Engine.

  from the main menu should give the correct prompt. The associated shortcuts are also added here.
* Updated the shortcut and installer checklist to ensure that the extensions with the same name are properly used.
